# Average-Calculator
This was my first time using a graphical user interface for the Java language. Coded on an older version version of Java SE 8 when Applet was supported. Oracle discontinued Applet support for Java SE 11.
Takes in 4 course marks and calculates the average. GUI interface using Applet. Programmed in Java using Apache NetBeans IDE.
