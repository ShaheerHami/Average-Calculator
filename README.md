# Average-Calculator
This was my first time using a graphical user interface for the Java language. Coded on an older version version of Java SE. Oracle discontinued Applet support for Java SE 11. To be able to run this program you must use Java SE 8.
Takes in 4 course marks and calculates the average. Programmed using Apache NetBeans IDE.
