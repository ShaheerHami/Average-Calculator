# Average-Calculator
This was my first time using a graphical user interface for the Java language. Coded on an older version of Java SE. To be able to run this program you must use Java SE 8 because Oracle discontinued Applet support for Java SE 11. 
Takes in 4 course marks and calculates the average. Programmed using Apache NetBeans IDE.
